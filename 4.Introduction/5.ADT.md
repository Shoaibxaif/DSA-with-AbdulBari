**Abstract Data Types (ADT)** :

1. **Data Type**: It is defined by two factors:

   - **Representation of data**: How the data is stored.
   - **Operations on data**: What operations can be performed on the data.

   For example, in C or C++, an integer is represented by 2 bytes (16 bits), where 1 bit is reserved for the sign, and the remaining 15 bits store the number. Operations on integers include arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.), relational operators (<, >), and increment/decrement operations.

2. **Abstract**: In programming, abstraction means hiding internal details. For example, you use an integer without knowing its internal binary representation or how operations are performed on it. You simply use it through its allowed operations.

3. **Abstract Data Type (ADT)**: It involves defining both the **representation of data** and the **operations on data**. For example, in object-oriented programming (OOP), ADTs can be defined as classes, where the internal representation of data is hidden, and only the operations on the data are exposed. This allows developers to use the data without worrying about how it is stored or manipulated internally.

4. **Example of List ADT**:

   - A list is a collection of elements. It can be represented using an array or a linked list in a program.
   - To represent a list, you need:
     - Space to store elements.
     - Capacity (maximum size).
     - Size (number of elements currently in the list).
   - Operations on a list include adding elements, removing elements, and searching for specific elements.

5. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **ADT**: When you define a class in OOP (e.g., in C++), you combine both the data representation and operations, effectively defining an ADT. The internal implementation (whether it's an array, linked list, etc.) is abstracted, and users can interact with the list via its operations.

In summary, an ADT is a conceptual data type that allows you to focus on operations while abstracting the details of how the data is represented or manipulated. The List ADT is an example where you define how a list behaves (operations) but hide how itâ€™s implemented (e.g., using arrays or linked lists).
