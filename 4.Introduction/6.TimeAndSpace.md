**Time Complexity**

* **Definition:** Measures the time taken by an algorithm to execute as a function of the input size.
* **Notation:** Often represented using Big O notation, e.g., O(n), O(n^2), O(log n), etc.

**Common Time Complexities:**

1. **O(1): Constant Time**
   - Operations take the same amount of time regardless of input size.
   - Example: Accessing an array element by index.

2. **O(log n): Logarithmic Time**
   - Time grows logarithmically with input size.
   - Example: Binary search.

3. **O(n): Linear Time**
   - Time grows linearly with input size.
   - Example: Traversing an array once.

4. **O(n log n): Linearithmic Time**
   - Time grows slightly faster than linear.
   - Example: Merge sort, quick sort.

5. **O(n^2): Quadratic Time**
   - Time grows quadratically with input size.
   - Example: Nested loops iterating over an array.

6. **O(n^3): Cubic Time**
   - Time grows cubically with input size.
   - Example: Three nested loops.

7. **Exponential Time**
   - Time grows exponentially with input size.
   - Example: Recursive algorithms with many function calls.

**Analyzing Time Complexity from Code:**

1. **Identify Loops:**
   - Each loop iteration contributes to the time complexity.
   - Nested loops multiply the complexity.

2. **Consider Function Calls:**
   - Analyze the time complexity of the called function.

3. **Ignore Constant Factors:**
   - Focus on the dominant term in the time complexity expression.

**Space Complexity**

* **Definition:** Measures the amount of memory used by an algorithm as a function of the input size.
* **Analysis:** Similar to time complexity, consider the space used for variables and data structures.

**Key Points:**

* **Time and space complexity are crucial for algorithm efficiency.**
* **Choose algorithms with lower time and space complexity for better performance.**
* **Understand the trade-offs between different algorithms.**
* **Practice analyzing code to determine time and space complexity.**
