# Static and Dynamic Memory Allocation

This document provides an overview of static and dynamic memory allocation, based on a detailed discussion from a video lecture.

## Memory Basics

- **Memory Structure**: 
  - The main memory is divided into smaller addressable units called **bytes**. 
  - Each byte has a unique **linear address** (e.g., 0, 1, 2,...).
  - Example: A memory of size **64 KB** will have addresses ranging from `0` to `65535`.

- **Assumption for Understanding**: 
  - We consider a segment of **64 KB** as the main memory for easier explanation, though modern systems use larger sizes like GBs.

## Division of Memory in a Program

When a program is executed, the memory is divided into three main sections:
1. **Code Section**: Stores the machine code of the program.
2. **Stack**: Used for static memory allocation, such as function variables.
3. **Heap**: Used for dynamic memory allocation.

### Code Section
- This is the region where the machine code of a program resides after being loaded into memory from the disk.

### Stack
- The **stack** is used for managing the memory required by function variables. 
- Memory allocation in the stack is **static** and determined at **compile-time**.

#### Example:
- Consider a program with two variables:
  - `int x` (takes 2 bytes)
  - `float y` (takes 4 bytes)
  - Total memory required: **6 bytes**
  
- This 6 bytes is allocated in the **stack** during program execution.

- **Stack Frame**: 
  - The memory block allocated to a function in the stack is called its **stack frame** or **activation record**.

### Heap
- The heap is used for **dynamic memory allocation** (discussed in later sections).

## Static Memory Allocation

- **Definition**: 
  - The memory size for variables is determined at compile time. 
  - Allocation occurs in the stack when the program runs.

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Size is **predefined** and does not change during runtime.
  - Compiler calculates the memory requirements beforehand.

- **Advantages**:
  - Simpler and faster to allocate and deallocate memory.
  - No runtime overhead for allocation logic.

- **Example**:
  ```c
  void main() {
      int a;  // Allocates 2 bytes
      float b; // Allocates 4 bytes
  }

Total stack memory allocated: 6 bytes.

##Summary

Static Memory Allocation:

Memory size is decided at compile time.
Allocation occurs in the stack.
Efficient but inflexible for changing memory requirements.
Dynamic Memory Allocation:

To be covered in detail in subsequent sections, involving heap utilization.
This explanation simplifies the understanding of how programs utilize memory and lays the groundwork for studying dynamic memory allocation.
