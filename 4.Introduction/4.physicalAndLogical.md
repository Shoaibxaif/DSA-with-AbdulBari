# Data Structures: Introduction and Classification

## Memory Overview
- **Static Memory Allocation**: Memory size is fixed during compile time.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Memory size can change during runtime.

## Classification of Data Structures
Data structures are categorized into:
1. **Physical Data Structures**  
2. **Logical Data Structures**

### 1. Physical Data Structures
These define how memory is organized and allocated for storing data.

#### Key Types:
- **Array**:
  - Collection of contiguous memory locations.
  - **Features**:
    - Fixed size (static memory allocation).
    - Supported directly by programming languages like C, C++, and Java.
    - Created in either the **stack** or **heap**.
  - **Use Case**: Suitable when the size of the data is known beforehand.

- **Linked List**:
  - Collection of nodes, each containing data and a link to the next node.
  - **Features**:
    - Variable size (dynamic memory allocation).
    - Always created in the **heap**.
    - The head pointer resides in the **stack**.
  - **Use Case**: Suitable when the size of the data is not known beforehand.

### 2. Logical Data Structures
These define the discipline of data usage and operations (insertion, deletion, etc.).

#### Types:
- **Stack**:
  - Follows **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** discipline.
- **Queue**:
  - Follows **FIFO (First In, First Out)** discipline.
- **Tree**:
  - Hierarchical structure of nodes.
- **Graph**:
  - Collection of nodes connected by edges.
- **Hash Table**:
  - Tabular structure used for fast access via keys.

#### Characteristics:
- Logical data structures are implemented using **physical data structures** (Array, Linked List, or a combination).

## Summary
- **Physical Data Structures** are responsible for storing data in memory.
- **Logical Data Structures** focus on how to utilize the stored data and perform operations.
- Logical structures like Stack, Queue, Trees, and Graphs are built using physical structures like Arrays and Linked Lists.

## Next Steps
- Learn **Array** and **Linked List** in detail.
- Implement logical data structures using physical ones.
- Explore advanced topics, such as variations of queues, trees, and graphs.
