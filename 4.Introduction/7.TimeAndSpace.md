### **Understanding Time Complexity**
1. **Basic Concept**:
   - Each simple statement (e.g., arithmetic operation, assignment) is assumed to take one unit of time.
   - Time complexity is derived by summing up the time taken by all statements.

2. **For Loops**:
   - A `for` loop running `n` times contributes `O(n)` to the time complexity.
   - Nested loops multiply their contributions:
     - A loop inside another loop running `n` times each leads to `O(n^2)`.

3. **Analyzing Functions**:
   - Functions with constant statements (e.g., `swap(x, y)`) take constant time: `O(1)`.
   - Functions with loops or calls to other functions may take linear (`O(n)`) or higher-order time.

### **Examples**:
1. **Swap Function**:
   - Code:
     ```c
     temp = x;
     x = y;
     y = temp;
     ```
   - Each statement takes constant time (`1 unit`).
   - Total: `O(1)` (constant time complexity).

2. **Summing an Array**:
   - Code:
     ```c
     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
         sum += arr[i];
     }
     ```
   - Loop runs `n` times. Each iteration has one addition.
   - Total: `O(n)`.

3. **Nested Loops**:
   - Code:
     ```c
     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
         for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
             sum += i + j;
         }
     }
     ```
   - Outer loop runs `n` times. Inner loop also runs `n` times for each outer iteration.
   - Total iterations: `n * n = n^2`.
   - Time complexity: `O(n^2)`.

4. **Function Calls**:
   - If a function calls another function with `O(n)` complexity, its complexity includes that of the called function.

### **General Guidelines**:
- Look at the **largest contributing factor** (dominant term) in the time function.
- Ignore lower-order terms and constants.
  - Example: `f(n) = 2n + 3` simplifies to `O(n)`.
  - `f(n) = n^2 + 2n + 1` simplifies to `O(n^2)`.

### **Key Insights**:
- Loops dominate time complexity.
- Nested loops significantly increase complexity (e.g., `O(n^2)` or `O(n^3)`).
- Use simple rules to analyze different constructs:
  - `for`/`while` loops → linear (`O(n)`), logarithmic (`O(log n)`), or higher.
  - Function calls → include the called function’s complexity.
