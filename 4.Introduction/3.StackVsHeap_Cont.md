# Memory Management: Stack and Heap

This document explains how memory is allocated during the execution of a program, specifically focusing on **Stack** and **Heap** memory.

## Stack Memory: Function Calls and Activation Records

The **stack** is a memory section used to store the execution context of function calls, including local variables and parameters. 

### Key Points:
1. **Execution Order**: 
   - The stack grows as functions are called and shrinks as functions return.
   - Each function has its **activation record** or **stack frame** to store:
     - Parameters passed to the function.
     - Local variables declared in the function.
     - Return address for the function.

2. **Example of Stack Usage**:
   ```c
   int main() {
       int a, b;
       fun1();
       return 0;
   }

   void fun1() {
       int x;
       fun2(x);
   }

   void fun2(int i) {
       int a;
   }
   ```
   - **Execution Flow**:
     1. `main()` is called: `a` and `b` are allocated in the stack.
     2. `fun1()` is called: Stack frame for `fun1()` is created, storing `x`.
     3. `fun2()` is called: Stack frame for `fun2()` is created with `i` and `a`.

3. **Stack Allocation**:
   - Stack frames are created in a **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** order.
   - When a function ends, its stack frame is removed, and the control returns to the caller.

4. **Characteristics of Stack Memory**:
   - Automatic allocation and deallocation.
   - Determined at compile time.
   - Organized and predictable.

## Heap Memory: Dynamic Allocation

The **heap** is a memory section used for dynamic memory allocation during the runtime of a program.

### Key Points:
1. **Characteristics**:
   - Memory is allocated and freed manually by the programmer.
   - Unlike the stack, heap memory is unorganized.

2. **Accessing Heap Memory**:
   - Cannot be accessed directly. Instead, use **pointers** to reference it.
   - Memory is allocated using functions like `malloc()` in C or the `new` operator in C++.

3. **Example of Heap Usage**:
   ```c
   int *ptr = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int)); // Allocates an array of 5 integers in the heap.
   ```
   - A pointer `ptr` is allocated in the stack to reference the heap memory.

4. **Allocation and Deallocation**:
   - Must explicitly free the memory using `free()` in C or `delete` in C++ to avoid memory leaks.

5. **Resource-Like Behavior**:
   - Similar to using a resource like a printer:
     - Request memory when needed.
     - Release memory when done.

## Comparison Between Stack and Heap

| Feature               | Stack                  | Heap                   |
|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Allocation Type**   | Static (Compile-time) | Dynamic (Runtime)      |
| **Access**            | Direct                | Indirect (via Pointers)|
| **Organization**      | Organized (LIFO)      | Unorganized            |
| **Speed**             | Faster                | Slower                 |
| **Memory Management** | Automatic             | Manual                 |

### Summary:
- **Stack**: Used for local variables and function call management; memory is allocated and deallocated automatically.
- **Heap**: Used for dynamic memory allocation; memory must be managed manually by the programmer.
