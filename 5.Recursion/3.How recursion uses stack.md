### Understanding Recursion and Stack Utilization

1. **Memory Model Overview**:
   - The computer's memory is divided into sections: **Code Section** (stores machine code), **Stack** (used for function calls), and **Heap** (dynamic memory allocation).
   - Functions and variables use the stack for execution.

2. **Execution Flow**:
   - The program begins execution from the `main()` function.
   - When a function is called, an **activation record** (or stack frame) is created for it. This record includes the function's local variables and parameters.
   - The stack grows as more functions are called and shrinks as they return.

3. **Recursive Function Example**:
   - Consider a function `fun1(int n)` that recursively calls itself until `n == 0`.
   - **Steps**:
     - When `fun1()` is called with `n = 3`, an activation record is created with `n = 3`.
     - Inside `fun1`, the condition `n > 0` is checked. If true, `fun1(n-1)` is called.
     - Each recursive call creates a new activation record with `n` decremented by 1 (`n = 2`, then `n = 1`, and finally `n = 0`).
   - **Termination**:
     - When `n == 0`, the base case is reached, no further recursive calls are made, and the function begins to return.
   - **Stack Unwinding**:
     - Each return deletes the corresponding activation record, freeing up stack space.
     - Control goes back to the previous call, completing any remaining statements in that context.

4. **Memory Consumption**:
   - Each recursive call occupies stack space equal to the size of its activation record.
   - For a recursive depth of `n`, the stack will hold `n+1` activation records (including the base case).
   - The space complexity is **O(n)**, as the stack size grows linearly with the depth of recursion.

5. **Key Observations**:
   - Recursive functions can be memory-intensive due to the stack space required for multiple activation records.
   - For large recursion depths, stack overflow may occur if the memory limit is exceeded.

6. **Improving Efficiency**:
   - Tail recursion optimizations (supported by some compilers) can reduce stack usage by reusing the current function's stack frame for the next call.
   - Alternatively, iterative approaches may be more space-efficient for some problems.
