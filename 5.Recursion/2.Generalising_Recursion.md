### Notes on Recursive Functions  

**1. Introduction to Recursive Functions:**  
- A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution.  
- It typically has two parts:  
  - **Base Case**: The condition where the function stops calling itself.  
  - **Recursive Case**: The part where the function calls itself with a reduced or smaller input.  

---

**2. Execution Phases in Recursion:**  
- Recursion involves **two distinct phases**:  
  - **Ascending Phase (Calling Time):**  
    - The part of the function where operations are performed *before* the recursive call.  
    - For example, statements that execute while the function keeps calling itself until the base case is reached.  
  - **Descending Phase (Returning Time):**  
    - The part of the function where operations are performed *after* the recursive calls return.  
    - For example, calculations or tasks executed during the return of recursive calls back to the initial call.

**Key Observations:**  
- Any code written before the recursive call is executed during the **ascending phase**.  
- Any code written after the recursive call is executed during the **descending phase**.

**3. Comparison of Recursion and Loops:**  
- Both **loops** and **recursion** are used to perform repetitive tasks.  
- **Loops**:  
  - Have a single phase (ascending).  
  - Iterate over a sequence or condition repeatedly until a termination condition is met.  
- **Recursion**:  
  - Involves two phases: ascending (calling) and descending (returning).  
  - Requires a base case to stop the recursion; otherwise, it results in infinite recursion.  

**Strength of Recursion:**  
- The **descending phase** in recursion allows tasks to be performed in reverse order, which is not straightforward in loops.  
- Makes complex problems like tree traversal, divide-and-conquer algorithms, and dynamic programming easier to implement.

**4. Utilization of Recursion:**  
- Recursive functions are widely used for problems like:  
  - Factorial calculation.  
  - Fibonacci sequence generation.  
  - Tree and graph traversal (e.g., Depth-First Search).  
  - Divide-and-conquer problems (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).  
  - Backtracking problems (e.g., solving a maze, n-Queens problem).

**5. Key Points to Remember:**  
- Always define a **base case** to prevent infinite recursion.  
- Understand the order of execution:  
  - **Ascending phase** (before recursion) → Recursive Call → **Descending phase** (after recursion).  
- Recursion can sometimes lead to stack overflow if the recursion depth exceeds the system’s stack limit.

**6. Advantages of Recursion:**  
- Simplifies complex problems.  
- Makes code shorter and easier to understand, especially for problems involving hierarchical or nested structures.  

**7. Disadvantages of Recursion:**  
- High memory usage due to function call stack.  
- Slower than loops for simple iterative tasks.

**8. Next Steps (Stack and Complexity in Recursion):**  
- Recursive calls use a **call stack** to maintain the state of each function call.  
- Time complexity and space complexity need to be analyzed carefully to optimize recursive functions.  

**Upcoming Topics:**  
- Understanding the role of stacks in recursion.  
- Analyzing the time complexity of recursive functions using recurrence relations.
